## Statistical Analysis
Distribution analysis of claim amounts (fraud vs. legitimate)
Temporal patterns (day of week, time of year)
Geographic clustering of fraudulent claims
Correlation analysis between features

## Visualization Requirements
Key visualizations to create:
1. Fraud rate by claim amount buckets
2. Time-to-report distribution comparison
3. Network graph of connected entities
4. Feature importance heatmap
5. Geographic fraud density map

## Identify Natural Fraud Indicators
Claims just below deductible
Multiple claims in short timeframe
Claims in first 30 days of policy
Unusual claim amounts for incident type
